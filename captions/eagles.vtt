00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:032.000
One of these nights, one of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out, pretty mama, what turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons, you got your desires
Well, I got a few of my own

2
00:00:32.000 --> 00:01:500
Oh, someone to be kind to in between the dark and the light
Oh, coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you, one of these nights


3
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.000
One of these dreams, one of these lost and lonely dreams, now
We're gonna find one, mm, one that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight


4
00:00:03.000 --> 00:03:23.500
Oh, loneliness will blind you in between the wrong and the right
Oh, coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you, one of these nights
One of these nights oh, in between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you
Get you, baby, one of these nights


5
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:33.500
One of these nights (oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh)
One of these nights (I can feel it, I can feel it)
One of these nights (coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you now)
One of these nights (and gets so dark, it's so dark and cold)
One of these nights (one of these crazy crazy crazy nights)
One of these nights (swear I'm gonna find you coming right behind you)
One of these nights (oh)
One of these nights (and I want to say ah)
One of these nights (one of these, one of these)
One of these nights (coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you)
One of these nights (One of these nights, one of these crazy nights)
